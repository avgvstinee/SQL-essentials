# SQL Essentials

Welcome to **SQL Essentials**! 🚀

This repository serves as a personal knowledge base and practice ground for SQL. Ideally suited for anyone looking to master SQL concepts through practical examples.

## 📚 Concepts Covered

The repository is organized by topic to foster structured learning:

### 🏗️ Table Management (`create_tables`)
- **Creating Tables**: Syntax and examples for defining new tables.
- **Dropping Tables**: How to delete tables safely.
- **Basic Selection**: Simple `SELECT` queries to retrieve data.

### 🛡️ Constraints & Data Integrity
- **Primary Keys (`primary_keys`)**: Defining unique identifiers for your records.
- **Default Constraints (`default_contraints`)**: Setting default values for columns when no value is specified.
- **Not Null Constraints (`not_null_constraints`)**: Ensuring critical data is always present (handling `NULL`s).

### 🔍 Data Filtering & Manipulation (`filtering_rows`)
- **Filtering**: Extensive examples using:
    - `WHERE` clause with `AND`, `OR` operators.
    - `IN` and `NOT IN` operators for list matching.
    - `BETWEEN` and `NOT BETWEEN` for range filtering.
    - Equality and inequality operators (`=`, `!=`, `<>`).
- **Modifying Data**:
    - `UPDATE`: Modifying existing records.
    - `DELETE`: Removing records.

## 🛠 Usage

Each `.sql` file is self-contained and demonstrates a specific concept. You can run these scripts against your SQL database management system (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server) to see the results and understand the behavior.

## 🎯 Goal

My goal is to build a comprehensive reference for SQL, covering everything from the basics to advanced topics. I'm actively adding new concepts and examples.

## 📅 Status

I am committed to adding more concepts daily. Stay tuned for updates!
